## Overview of Election Audit
In this project, I assisted Tom in auditing the tabulated results for the U.S Congressional precinct in Colorado. We were tasked with reporting the number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election. This audit was automated using Python. In this deliverable a script has been provided that will run, the following information when run: 

Total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
Total number of votes each candidate received
Percentage of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote

## Election-Audit Results
Using the election, I was able to programmatically count up all the votes that were cast in this election. This number was discovered to be 369, 771. Among the votes cast, Charles Casper Stockham received 85, 213 votes (about 23% of total votes), Diane Gette received 272, 892 votes (about 73.8% of total votes), and lastly, Raymon Anthony Doane received 11, 606 (about 3.1% of total votes). The winner of this election with an overwhelming majority is Diane Gette, she received about 74% of all the votes cast. 

## Election-Audit Summary
This particular election data, while impressively large, does not measure up to the massive amounts of data that will be collected during federal, or state elections. The script must be modified to account for a larger candidate pool, increased number of counties and cities.
